# Weather Reports App  

A Python-based application that retrieves live weather data for specific cities and securely stores it in an AWS S3 bucket.  

## Features  
- Fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API.  
- Automatically creates an S3 bucket if it doesn't already exist.  
- Stores weather data in JSON format in the specified S3 bucket.  
- Handles errors gracefully for API calls and AWS operations.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Core programming language for the app.  
- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage for saving weather data.  
- **OpenWeather API**: Source for real-time weather data.  
- **boto3**: AWS SDK for Python, used for S3 operations.  
- **requests**: Library for handling HTTP requests.  
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.  

## Prerequisites  
1. **Python 3.x** installed on your system.  
2. **AWS Account**: With an IAM user having access to S3.  
3. **OpenWeather API Key**: Obtain from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).  
4. **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with your credentials.  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sherifsani/weather-reports.git
   cd weather-reports-app
   ```  

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```  

3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

4. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your credentials:  
   ```env
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key  
   AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name  
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key  
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key  
   ```  

## Usage  

1. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  

2. The app will:  
   - Check if the specified S3 bucket exists and create it if needed.  
   - Fetch weather data for predefined cities (`Philadelphia`, `Seattle`, and `New York`).  
   - Print weather details (temperature, humidity, conditions, etc.) in the console.  
   - Save the weather data in the S3 bucket in JSON format.  

## Project Structure  

```
weather-reports-app/  
├── main.py               # Main script to run the application  
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies  
├── .env                  # Environment variables (not included in the repo)  
├── README.md             # Project documentation  
└── .gitignore            # Files to ignore in version control  
```  

## Example Output  

Console:  
```text  
Fetching weather for Philadelphia...  
Temperature: 50°F  
Feels like: 48°F  
Humidity: 70%  
Conditions: clear sky  
Weather data for Philadelphia saved to S3!  
```  

S3 Bucket:

├── Seattle-20250118-121532.json  
└── New York-20250118-121534.json  
```  

## Potential Improvements  
- Add a UI for user interaction.  
- Schedule regular updates using AWS Lambda or a cron job.  
- Include additional cities dynamically.
